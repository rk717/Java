### Task 1

A point (`Point`) has the coordinates` x`, `y` (type` int`). Such points can be (completely) sorted by lexicographic sorting. Using this sort, implement the `compareTo ()` method. Organize a list of points as an example.

### Task 2

Write a `ExtendedString` class that stores data of type` String`, comparable to the length of the string (`compareTo ()`), iterated per character (`iterator ()`).
